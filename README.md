# E-commerce Scraping script

We used this script at Data Hackaton 2024 to scrape all products that we needed to train our AI agent. 

How it works:
- Get information about pages and html elements needed
- All products has their own link on the e-commerce so we create list of them
- After this, the elements we need are scraped to the `txt` file.

It can be modified to almost every e-commerce.
